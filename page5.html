  Deep,
<br>  Did you look deeper at how the world will look like?
<br>  What do I think? If you want to know
<br>  you only need to look deeper...

          Assume that we choose the world to be only evil, <br>
          everything you do has only unethical bases<br>
           and is justified by the nature of existence.
      <br>    Humanity will diminish because as a human we live in groups
      <br>     and if the ethical actions we do disappear
    <br>       the nature of our relationship with each other
      <br>      will involve unethical practices.
      <br>     As a result, only the stronger will survive
      <br>      which is a few enough to keep the species alive.
      <br>    The same argument will apply to only good in the world.
<br>      The nature of our existence requires unethical desires
<br>      that from pure ethics, it not justified. So,
<br>       itâ€™s hypothetically impossible to exist in only good or only bad.
<br>          Again the contradictions appear.
