  Until now, we saw how the way we perceive things is a reflection of ourselves as a human.
    <br>Our way of looking at things replicate the idea of contradicts. During the entire time,
    <br> the only colors that you saw are Black&white.Both of them are a representation of
  <br>    good and evil, right or wrong. The only question to ask is,
  <br>    first you should play a game with me. Can you find the word that
  <br>     describes the contradictions in the form of a color.
  <br>     Think about the black and white.

        <br>  Can a world with only evil or only good survive?
        <br>  Or everything is going to fall apart?
        <br>  Imagen this possibility where everything we do is evil,
        <br>  what world we will live in? Donâ€™t forget to think in deep.
